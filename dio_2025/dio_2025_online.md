# Online Participation at DiO 2025

Dear online attendees: Welcome to DiO 2025! 
To foster engagement during live sessions, you will have the opportunity to submit **questions for speakers through chat**, and participate in live polls and other interactive initiatives.
We also encourage you to connect with fellow participants in our specially designed **coffee chat spaces**, accessible between sessions to offer informal environments for discussion on key themes and debriefing "the previous session." 

We welcome your **suggestions for new topics, thoughts and ideas** regarding online participation via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuQ_PWOVqYDc_yaA-pufSIMUO_vxYdm0C1SBTW0y1FWORbjw/viewform?usp=dialog), or the link in your email.

The form will be active throughout the conference and will be checked regularly.

We hope your virtual attendance will be productive and enjoyable!
